# **Android Portfolio** #

Hello and welcome to my Android Portfolio section, here you will find some projects that I developed which most of them for self-learning purposes so feel free to explore them. 
I hope you enjoy it !

# **About the projects** #

In order to have a better visualization I created this repository to group/migrate my Android projects into a single repository but the original repos still exist separately. Each folder contains a functional project and everything you need to build them, but if you still want to clone the original repos you can find them according the following list:

- [Sunshine project](https://github.com/walternunes/sunshine)
- [CineMovies project](https://github.com/walternunes/Cine-movies)
- [FootballMatches project](https://github.com/walternunes/football-matches)
- [xyz-reader project](https://github.com/walternunes/xyz-reader)

If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
