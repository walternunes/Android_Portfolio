Sunshine is a weather forecast application for Android that uses the OpenWeather API. This application is part of the Udacity Android developer nanodegree.

The application is different from the original because I made some changes and improvements.

You can find more information about OpenWeather API in the bellow link.
API: http://openweathermap.org/api

### Set up the project ###

In order to build this project is necessary to have an API key. If you don't have one please register and request your own API key here: http://openweathermap.org/register.

Next you will need to add a String named "api_key" into your resources file that could be a new XML file or the String.xml itself. According to the bellow example:
<string name="api_key" translatable="false">your_key_here</string>
